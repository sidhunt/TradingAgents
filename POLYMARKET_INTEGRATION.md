# Polymarket Integration for TradingAgents

## Overview

The TradingAgents framework has been extended to support prediction markets, specifically integrating with Polymarket. This allows the multi-agent trading system to analyze and trade binary outcome events alongside traditional financial instruments.

## What's New

### üîÆ Prediction Market Support
- **Market Data Integration**: Fetch events, prices, and analytics from Polymarket
- **Specialized Analyst**: Dedicated prediction market analyst agent
- **Risk Management**: Adapted risk controls for binary outcome trading
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Separate allocation strategy for prediction markets

### üìä New Data Sources
- **Polymarket Events**: Get trending prediction markets by category
- **Market Analytics**: Historical prices, volume, and volatility analysis
- **Trending Markets**: Identify high-volume, high-uncertainty opportunities

## How It Works

### 1. Data Flow Integration

The system now includes three new data utilities:

```python
# Get events by category
from tradingagents.dataflows import get_polymarket_events
events = get_polymarket_events('crypto', limit=10)

# Analyze specific markets
from tradingagents.dataflows import get_polymarket_market_analysis
analysis = get_polymarket_market_analysis('market_001_yes')

# Find trending opportunities
from tradingagents.dataflows import get_trending_prediction_markets
trending = get_trending_prediction_markets(limit=5)
```

### 2. Agent Integration

A new **Prediction Market Analyst** agent has been added to the agent ecosystem:

```python
from tradingagents.agents import create_prediction_market_analyst

# Create the analyst
analyst = create_prediction_market_analyst(llm, toolkit)

# The analyst specializes in:
# - Probability assessment vs. market prices
# - Volume and liquidity analysis
# - Event fundamental analysis
# - Binary outcome risk evaluation
```

### 3. Live Trading Integration

The live trading system now supports prediction markets:

```python
class PersonalTradingAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = {
            "enable_prediction_markets": True,
            "prediction_market_allocation": 0.30,  # 30% of portfolio
            "prediction_market_max_position": 0.05,  # 5% per position
        }
    
    async def get_market_opportunities(self):
        # Returns both stocks and prediction markets
        # Prediction markets prefixed with "PM:"
        return ["AAPL", "TSLA", "PM:market_001_yes"]
```

## Key Features

### üéØ Prediction Market Analysis
- **Probability Assessment**: Compare market prices to estimated true probabilities
- **Volume Analysis**: Identify liquid markets suitable for trading
- **Event Evaluation**: Analyze underlying events and their likelihood
- **Market Inefficiencies**: Spot mispriced markets due to sentiment or bias

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management
- **Binary Outcome Risk**: 100% loss if wrong (vs. partial losses in traditional markets)
- **Time Decay**: Value approaches 0 or 1 as resolution date approaches
- **Liquidity Risk**: May be difficult to exit positions in smaller markets
- **Resolution Risk**: Depends on oracle/resolution mechanism accuracy

### üí∞ Portfolio Allocation
- **Separate Allocation**: Prediction markets get their own allocation (default 30%)
- **Position Sizing**: Smaller positions due to binary risk (default max 5%)
- **Diversification**: Spread across multiple uncorrelated events

## Usage Examples

### Basic Market Analysis

```python
# Test the integration
python test_polymarket_integration.py
```

### Demo Trading Workflow

```python
# See how prediction markets integrate with traditional trading
python demo_polymarket_trading.py
```

### Live Trading with Prediction Markets

```python
# Enable prediction markets in live trading
from live_trading_plan import PersonalTradingAgent

agent = PersonalTradingAgent()
agent.config["enable_prediction_markets"] = True
agent.config["prediction_market_allocation"] = 0.20  # 20% of portfolio

# The agent will now analyze both stocks and prediction markets
```

## Configuration Options

### Prediction Market Settings

```python
config = {
    "enable_prediction_markets": True,           # Enable/disable prediction market trading
    "prediction_market_allocation": 0.30,       # Max % of portfolio for prediction markets
    "prediction_market_max_position": 0.05,     # Max % per individual position
    "prediction_market_categories": ["crypto", "economics", "politics"],  # Categories to analyze
    "prediction_market_min_volume": 50000,      # Minimum volume for consideration
    "prediction_market_max_time_to_resolution": 90,  # Max days to resolution
}
```

## Market Categories Supported

- **Crypto**: Bitcoin price predictions, protocol upgrades, adoption metrics
- **Economics**: Fed rate decisions, GDP growth, inflation outcomes
- **Politics**: Election results, policy outcomes, regulatory decisions
- **Sports**: Game outcomes, season results, performance metrics
- **Technology**: Product launches, company milestones, adoption rates

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Value-Based Trading
- Identify markets where price ‚â† true probability
- Look for information asymmetries
- Focus on your areas of expertise

### 2. Volume-Based Trading
- Trade high-volume markets for better liquidity
- Avoid thin markets with wide spreads
- Monitor volume trends for market sentiment

### 3. Time-Based Trading
- Consider time decay as resolution approaches
- Early positions for long-term events
- Last-minute trading on breaking news

## Risk Considerations

### Unique Risks of Prediction Markets
1. **Binary Outcomes**: Either 0% or 100% return
2. **Time Decay**: Value erosion as resolution approaches
3. **Liquidity**: May be difficult to exit positions
4. **Resolution**: Depends on oracle accuracy
5. **Regulatory**: Legal status varies by jurisdiction

### Risk Mitigation
- **Position Sizing**: Keep positions small (1-5% of portfolio)

- **Time Management**: Avoid positions close to resolution
- **Liquidity Checks**: Ensure adequate market depth
