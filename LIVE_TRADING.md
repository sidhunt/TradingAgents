## ü§ñ How It Works

### Agent Workflow

The live trading system follows this continuous workflow:

1. **Market Hours Check** (every 5 minutes when closed)
   - Only trades during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
   - Waits during weekends and holidays

2. **Market Analysis** (every 15 minutes during market hours)
   - Market Analyst: Overall market conditions
   - News Analyst: Breaking news impact
   - Fundamentals Analyst: Technical indicators

3. **Research & Debate** (every 30 minutes)
   - Bull Researcher: Bullish opportunities
   - Bear Researcher: Risk warnings
   - Research Manager: Final recommendations

4. **Trading Decisions** (continuous)
   - Trader Agent: Execute based on consensus
   - Risk Manager: Position sizing and limits
   - Portfolio Manager: Final approval

5. **Position Management** (continuous)
   - Stop loss monitoring (-5% default)
   - Take profit targets (+10% default)
   - End-of-day position closing

### Risk Management

**Daily Limits:**
- Maximum daily loss: 20% of starting balance
- Maximum daily trades: 10
- Pause after 3 consecutive losses
- Resume after 1-hour cooldown

**Position Sizing:**
- Never risk more than 10% on a single trade
- Keep 20% cash reserve
- Maximum 3 concurrent positions
- Scale positions based on account size

**Safety Features:**
- If balance < $50: Reduce position sizes by 50%
- If balance < $25: Switch to paper trading mode
- If balance > $200: Increase position sizes by 25%
- Emergency stop if balance reaches $0
